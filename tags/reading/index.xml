      <description>This is a breakdown of the encyclical Fratelli Tutti [1] written by Pope Francis.
The encyclical covers a wide range of topics and displays a generally more political tone while attempting to balance diverging viewpoints. Sometimes this leads to over-simplification or self-contradiction.
This note primarily discusses socio-economic subjects and reference numbers are provided for the appropriate sections of the encyclical.
   Topic Summary Comments     Culture Exporting or copying cultural models reduces national identity (#51) and different cultures are not enemies (#147).</description>

      <description>This is a brief summary of takeaways from reading Cynical Theories [1] by James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose of &amp;ldquo;grievance studies affair&amp;rdquo; [2] infamy.
Overall, the book does an excellent job outlining the history of the overarching worldview termed &amp;ldquo;critical theory&amp;rdquo; as well as presenting a number of succinct counter arguments against it.
The most interesting topics covered are the breakdowns of the individual fields within the broader philosophy.
Tracing specific ancestries and outlining each field&amp;rsquo;s current form and emphasis within the umbrella is highly valuable; it highlights both specific facets that the laity may more successfully understand and grapple with as well as potentially destructive tensions between the fields making up &amp;ldquo;critical theory.</description>
