      <description>Classic economics are primarily concerned with the balance of supply and demand in the marketplace. Balancing these two factors form the basis for current market operations based on individuals making production and consumption decisions in an open exchange.

The second assumption is that our workforce is becoming increasingly automated; direct human involvement is gradually being replaced by automated tools and processes.</description>
