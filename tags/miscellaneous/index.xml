      <title>Political Duopoloy</title>

      <description>Established political duopolies hold their members on platforms that can devolve into what can be summarized as &amp;ldquo;anti-opposing party.&amp;rdquo; Time is spent condemning the opposition&amp;rsquo;s stances without defending, or sometimes even presenting, alternatives. While there may be philosophic stratification within the dual parties, these differences are subordinate to the party positions.
Splitting these duopolies into multiple mini-parties encourages more active discourse and requires proactive engagement among colleagues when presenting and defending positions.</description>

      <title>Small Team Skill</title>

      <description>One of the most important skills a small team can collectively have is the ability to identify what they don&amp;rsquo;t need to build for a minimum viable product (&amp;ldquo;MVP&amp;rdquo;).
Smaller teams inherently have fewer human resources available to build things and must prioritize. An open two-way dialogue between the team and the customer helps identify the core value the product provides the customers. With this the team can provide that initial core value in their MVP even if it&amp;rsquo;s held together with rubber bands and bubble gum.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s worth reiterating that you are born with nothing and no one owes you anything. All you have are your rights and even those have been endowed to you.
 Remember you are dust and unto dust you shall return.

      <description>So many people forget that fifty percent of every conversation between two people is silence.
Active listening is a real thing; when I realize someone is really listening, the conversation has real meaning. I strive to provide the same attention.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re kicking back in the evening&amp;hellip;
 Enjoy the first sip of your beer.
 Especially when you&amp;rsquo;ve held off drinking all week and Friday rolls around.</description>

      <description>The king who avoids war at all costs is the king to avoid in war.
 Those who are passionate for peace will passionately pursue its return.</description>

      <description>Building simple solutions is fun.
This falls in with my overall philosophy of minimalism. Build lots of simple solutions and then weave them together to form something big.</description>

      <description>Work is still work - it isn&amp;rsquo;t always fun. But it sucks when it used to be.
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit whiny but feeling burnout at work, especially when the environment used to be engaging, fun, dynamic, and rewarding, really sucks.</description>

      <title>Craftsmanship Pride</title>

      <description>An important aspect of craftsmanship is earning the pride you take in your work.
The &amp;ldquo;niche&amp;rdquo; production approach where output is owned by the individuals who produce it, as encouraged by distributism, encourages thoughtful satisfaction in one&amp;rsquo;s accomplishment.</description>

      <description>Donâ€™t build statues to people who are still alive.
 Best practice to avoid making people into gods in their own minds.</description>

      <description>Where you&amp;rsquo;re from is only important if you&amp;rsquo;ve never left - otherwise, what matters is where you&amp;rsquo;re going.
Maybe a tad cliche, but whatever.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Dignity</title>

      <guid>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/vulnerable-dignity-1-0/</guid>
      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in a loss in dignity simply because one is vulnerable. There is no shame in asking for help. There is only shame in demanding it or denying it.</description>

      <description>Friends don&amp;rsquo;t perform favors for friends, they just help their friends when they need it.
Sort of a cheesy thing to say, but I believe it.</description>

      <title>Family Blood</title>

      <guid>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/family-blood-1-0/</guid>
      <description>Family is more than blood.
 While I think blood is a decent, in most cases, default binding connection, I believe we can hold those that we choose to associate ourselves with in similarly high regard.</description>

      <title>Unscripted Interactions</title>
      <link>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/unscripted-interactions-1-0/</link>

      <description>Unscripted interactions are the truest demonstration of a subject matter knowledge and interest.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred unscripted and unprompted discussions. I think the reason for this is because I think it shows a more genuine side of the subject.
For example, I prefer the live/unscripted entertainment bits provided by Rooster Teeth and Funhaus over the more choreographed pieces. Similarly, I think I received more thoughtful and groundbreaking insight from C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s notes and letter than I have from most of his &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; works.</description>

      <description>Provide alternatives, don&amp;rsquo;t poke holes.
Fight for the best idea, not yours.
Think flexibly.
 Just some small one-liners that I think are valuable for me to keep in mind when working with others.</description>
