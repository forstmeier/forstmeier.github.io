      <description>Impressionism [1] as a painting style has a strong personal, albeit uninformed, appeal.
The style prefers to see everything in a given scope without focusing on specific details. Produced images are more of a summary or a simplification of the subject which significantly reduces cognitive overhead in consuming these pieces.
A favorite is The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama [2] by Ã‰douard Manet, pictured below.
Personal highlights:
 smoke obscuring ship details or entire vessels quick lines for distant masts and rigging approximately two-thirds is water most of which is empty no specifics are conveyed on people in the image  </description>

      <title>Born With Nothing</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s worth reiterating that you are born with nothing and no one owes you anything. All you have are your rights and even those have been endowed to you.
 Remember you are dust and unto dust you shall return.

      <description>So many people forget that fifty percent of every conversation between two people is silence.
Active listening is a real thing; when I realize someone is really listening, the conversation has real meaning. I strive to provide the same attention.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re kicking back in the evening&amp;hellip;
 Enjoy the first sip of your beer.
 Especially when you&amp;rsquo;ve held off drinking all week and Friday rolls around.</description>

      <title>Where You&#39;re From</title>

      <description>Where you&amp;rsquo;re from is only important if you&amp;rsquo;ve never left - otherwise, what matters is where you&amp;rsquo;re going.
Maybe a tad cliche, but whatever.</description>

      <title>Friends Favors</title>

      <description>Friends don&amp;rsquo;t perform favors for friends, they just help their friends when they need it.
Sort of a cheesy thing to say, but I believe it.</description>

      <title>Family Blood</title>

      <description>Family is more than blood.
 While I think blood is a decent, in most cases, default binding connection, I believe we can hold those that we choose to associate ourselves with in similarly high regard.</description>
