			<p>Issuing equity in the company to employees is a common method employers use to distribute compensation. Shares can be distributed publicly or privately and most of the time they represent a literal voting ownership of the enterprise. When treated as compensation, equity is typically issued via a vesting schedule to the employees in question.</p>

<p>Equity differs from other compensation methods the most widespread of which, in my estimation, is a common salary or wage over some fixed or non-fixed distribution periods. Again, the exact nature of these distributions is determined by the contract that an employee has with their employer and for the purposes of this post, it isn&rsquo;t particularly important.</p>

<p>Here the focus is primarily on the juxtaposition against equity. What I propose here is a re-imagination of perspective on equity. Right now, most people likely look at equity from the view of the employee:</p>

<ol>
<li>The company issues shares according to the contract</li>
<li>The employee receives them and holds them as an asset</li>
<li>The shares convey dividends, voting rights, etc. to the employee</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the viewpoint that I expect is commonly held: the employee owns the company (and this is certainly the reality of the situation).</p>

<p>However, another way of looking at equity could be posited. Take an entirely opposite position - the companies are building equity in the employees. Before explaining that point, it&rsquo;s worth fleshing out the distinctions between the two compensation alternatives.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Equity</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>Here it&rsquo;s defined as a relatively non-liquid asset (assuming a private marketplace) which conveys financial value in the form of dividends (primarily) and non-financial value by way of voting rights in company decisions. This could be seen as representing a direct and more-or-less permanent investment in the company; this builds a link between the employee and the company who they hold equity of.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Salary/Wage</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>A highly liquid asset that conveys financial value immediately upon receipt and conveys no non-financial value. It&rsquo;s provided to the employee as long as the given employment contract is maintained and does not establish a permanent link between the employee and the company.</p>

<p>Now from the company&rsquo;s perspective, these two compensation methods offer different methods of securing productive resources in the labor of employees. One offers a temporary usage and the other establishes a permanent asset.</p>

<p>In some respects, this is similar to renting and apartment versus buying a house. The apartment is available while the contract is upheld and payments are made while the house, after the mortgage is paid off or the building is bought outright, is a permanent asset. Now these are very much generalizations, and specific scenarios will differ, but all things equal, they do illustrate the starkly differing options.</p>

<p>There is certainly a time and place for each alternative, but it&rsquo;s worth evaluating from the company&rsquo;s perspective to determine which is appropriate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Equity creates equity in the employees from the point of view of the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be argued that this pattern is a literal implementation the somewhat condescending, HR-esque phrase &ldquo;employees are the company&rsquo;s most important asset.&rdquo; And of course, the realistic, and probably ideal scenario, is one in which both financial and non-financial resources are consistently issued to the employee for their work through a salary and &ldquo;sweat equity&rdquo; agreements.</p>

<p>Instead of viewing employees as temporary or interchangeable assets, these equity-first companies would be building a stake in their employees and investing in them for the long-haul. Equity is a two-way street.</p>
