      <description>Within the spectrum of philosophical positions, distributism presents itself as an incredibly valuable economic theory - one in which both the fundamental value and rights of individual humans are focused on as primary tenets. It is this focus, an elevation of the individual among the many, that puts it in direct contrast with the more commonly argued capitalism and socialism.
Capitalism maintains free markets and privately-held productive resources while socialism holds resources centrally via the state and regulates market systems.</description>

      <description>Classic economics are primarily concerned with the balance of supply and demand in the marketplace. Balancing these two factors form the basis for current market operations based on individuals making production and consumption decisions in an open exchange. This open market supply-demand law is taken as one of two assumptions in this post&amp;rsquo;s thought experiment.
The second assumption is that our workforce is becoming increasingly automated; direct human involvement is gradually being replaced by automated tools and processes.</description>

      <description>Open source software has had a broadly positive impact on society.
Its resources have provided the basis for massive value creation and played key roles as the fundamental building blocks of technological innovation. There are dozens of available examples and it isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary to address them in this piece. Needless to say, open source has left a lasting mark on the world.
But there may be potential for it to do even more.</description>
