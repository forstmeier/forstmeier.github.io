      <description>Open source software has had a broadly positive impact on society.

      <description>This is a little collection of short works of science fiction dubbed The Bellefonte Trilogy. They&amp;rsquo;re in a continual &amp;ldquo;work-in-progress&amp;rdquo; state and will be steadily edited and refined going forward so changes both large and small should be expected. All of these changes can be seen in the Git history - feedback and comments are welcome.
