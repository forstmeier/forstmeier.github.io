## Description

Various little thoughts and comments that jumble out of my head. Some may mean something but most probably don’t - they just sound pretty. Some are also notes that can potentially be fleshed out more into publishable blurbs.

## Thoughts


> Boring problems often have fascinating solutions.

This may be more or less true, and is likely dependent on personal experience, but I’ve found that boring problems have typically been left un-explored for the very reason that they’re boring. This makes it all new territory for something venturing into it. Whatever they make will be entirely new.


> Favor requirements over processes while building. When you do need a process, automate it.

By this I mean *quality* or *production* requirements rather than build specifications. Creating process pipelines likely stifles creativity - anything need a process should be automated and never thought about.


> A minimal toolset necessitates creative solutions and efficient design.

I’m a firm believer in this. It’s sort of like building with a limited number of LEGOs: it forces you to think creatively and with imagination while also knowing intimately the number of pieces you have left and how they can work together.


> Building simple solutions is fun.

This falls in with my overall philosophy of minimalism. Build lots of simple solutions and then weave them together to form something big.


> So many people forget that fifty percent of every conversation between two people is silence.

Active listening is a real thing; when I realize someone is really listening, the conversation has real meaning. I strive to provide the same attention.


> Provide alternatives, don't poke holes.
> Fight for the best idea, not yours.
> Think flexibly.

Just some small one-liners that I think are valuable for me to keep in mind when working with others.


> An idea is like a cup of water. To make it a reality, you go to the beach and add sand to the cup of water. This takes time, uses the whole cup, and doesn't guarantee a strong foundation. If instead you pour the water out, you won't be able to keep it, but you and other hands can build a sandcastle rapidly, efficiently, and adaptably.

A thought on why ideas or intellectual property are better shared and open.


> The state is a monopoly; democracy is out best way of introducing competition.

I generally stand against any kind of monopoly and I think the state can be described in this way. Now, I don't want it abolished, but I do want it reined in.


> Friends don't perform favors for friends, they just help their friends when they need it.

Sort of a cheesy thing to say, but I believe it.


> Family is more than blood.

While I think blood is a decent, in most cases, default, I believe we can hold those that we choose to associate ourselves with in similarly high regard.


> Unscripted interactions are the truest demonstration of a subject matter knowledge and interest.

I've always preferred unscripted and unprompted discussions. I think the reason for this is because I think it shows a more genuine side of the subject. For example, I prefer the live/unscripted entertainment bits provided by Rooster Teeth and Funhaus over the more choreographed pieces. Similarly, I think I received more thoughtful and groundbreaking insight from C.S. Lewis's notes and letter than I have from most of his "official" works.


> Don’t build statues to people who are still alive.

Best practice to avoid making people into gods in their own minds.


> The greatest truths are simple.

Probably one of the most important things I've learned from C.S. Lewis.


> Where you're from is only important if you've never left - otherwise, what matters is where you're going

Maybe a tad cliche, but whatever.


> There is no shame in asking for help. There is only shame in demanding it or denying it.

I don't believe in a loss in dignity simply because one is vulnerable.


> Work is still work - it isn't always fun. But it sucks when it used to be.

Its a bit whiny but feeling burnout at work, especially when the environment used to be engaging, fun, dynamic, and rewarding, really sucks.


> The goal of increased individual self-direction requires providing both the individual decision-making capacity and the resources to take action with.

Sort of a personal goal that all work will ideally build towards. Individuals should be maximally free to self-direct and be able to utilize as many resources as possible to, in many cases, engage in productive endeavors.


> Many innovations today focus on making life easier - why not build things that make life more challenging?

This sounds silly but I like the idea of building things that push us forward and challenge us physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, philosophically. Things like hard science and deep tech are going to really push us more than service-based innovation.


> Variables utilized in human decision making should be based in the natural world rather than arbitrary selection.

An example of this is consent. In order for consent to be actually given, the individual has to be fully cognizant of the situation and not coerced. Being cognizant would, theoretically, require a fully developed brain - although this can’t be accurately assessed on-demand and on a case-by-case basis, the age for consent (alcohol, military service, driving, sex, etc.) should be placed on the average (at the time of this writing I believe that occurs around 25 years old).


> I want the Church to be personal, not individual.

This sort of goes in line with my view that the Church can be smaller in a literal sense of the organization. However, it needs to be balanced against non-conformity and subjective interpretation of doctrine.


> Collaboration, communication, community.

These are three core principles I look for in projects I associate myself with. Open/active discussions about the roadmap with no one individual deciding things, clearly and consistently adhering to a roadmap, and including all stakeholders in formalizing the roadmap.


> Sometimes facilitating conversation is more important than contributing to it.

Try working with developers talking past each other for thirty minutes and you'll see how this makes sense.


> Enjoy the first sip of your beer.

Especially when you've held off all week and Friday rolls around..


> The king who avoids war at all costs is the king to avoid in war.

Those who are passionate for peace will passionately pursue its return.
