					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Following the Georgist model, a citizen's dividend would have the side effect of providing an additional method for defining and enforcing sovereign territory. Legal citizens would receive the non-guaranteed dividend, pro rata, which would generally shift prices higher in the region they spend it - predominantly where they live. A resource disparity would arise between the citizens and the citizens of neighboring countries. Individuals entering the country would not be entitled to the dividend and would face the hurdle of the "economic mesa" in order to live within the national borders which would encourage legal immigration.

            An example of this is consent. In order for consent to be actually given, the individual has to be fully cognizant of the situation and not coerced. Being cognizant would, theoretically, require a fully developed brain - although this can’t be accurately assessed on-demand and on a case-by-case basis, the age for consent (alcohol, military service, driving, sex, etc.) should be placed on the average (at the time of this writing I believe that occurs around 25 years old).

						Maximizing productive output while maintaining individual rights and dignity is the primary concern in an increasingly automated workforce system.

						<b>Benefits</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Common knowledge pool: shared and open intellectual property which reduces "reinvention" by participants creating proprietary alternatives</li>
							<li>Non-overlaping markets: entities focus on "peripheral" markets surrounding shared core which encourages focus on competitive advantages</li>
							<li>Lower entry barriers: new participants can enter market rapidly as core intellectual property is openly available for use</li>
							<li>Value creation prioritization: more value is created from open resources than are captured by each individual producer</li>
							<li>Balances market forces: monopolization and perfect competition are avoided through public core resources and competitive advantage focuses</li>
							<li>Supply chain cooperation: "niche" edge producers collaborating between individual horizontal and vertical segments</li>
							<li>Adaptive technologies: common core resources with multiple contributors provides rapid updates for changing environments/requirements</li>

					<blockquote>
						<p>Open source philosophy is a force for economic good.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Open source software projects are a collaborative effort. Individual developers contribute to the betterment of the project and create a publicly available, shared resource.
					</p>
					<p>
						This model opts to create, rather than directly capture, value. Additionally, competitive markets are maintained around the project since individuals are free to take it and build products or services using it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since all parties share core intellectual property, competition is encouraged around the "edges" and where comparative advantages apply with some participants opting to keep these facets closed source. Dynamic, open economic theaters are created through this paradigm while also preventing monopolies from forming. Changing the default economic mindset to open collaborative competition, as maintained in the open source philosophy, is a significant social benefit and could be applied to all markets.<a href="https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2176&amp;context=btlj">[1]</a>
