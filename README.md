> Personal GitHub Pages site :hammer_and_wrench:

## description

**forstmeier.github.io** is the code repository and hosting platform for
John Forstmeier's personal website. This is primarily a micro-blogging
space with links to relevant external site profiles.

## notes

Below are several points regarding the **Notes** content on the site.

- All micro-blog posts are original content and may be linked to with appropriate attribution
- Changes may be retroactively made to this content
	- Scope of these changes will primarily be for typos and fixes as well as minor wording changes
- A "versioning" system may be introduced as individual ideas are adjusted
	- Version numbers would be visible in the landing page Notes list and the Note title
	- The pattern would be `major.minor` as integers
		- `major`: increments would indicate expanding or adjusting the Note theme
		- `minor`: increments would indicate continuing or fleshing out the Note theme
- Tags associated with each Note are a loose representation of the contents of the Note
- Older posts have been given approximate publish dates
	- These were consolidated from a prior platform or split into smaller pieces from previously larger posts
- All changes are reflected in the Git history for reference

Build well :hammer_and_wrench:
