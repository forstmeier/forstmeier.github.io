Below is a loose, unordered collection of "radical", but practically implementable, ideas for the U.S. political system. These have not been evaluated for completeness - this is a braindump. However, they may be expanded on individually in the future.

**Ideas**

1. **Comprehensive Federal term limits**: all Federal-level roles, including the Vice Presidency, the Senate, the House, and the Supreme Court, would be term-limited. Service could be potentially capped at eight years each. 

> _Goal_: reducing influence consolidation and office permanence.

2. **Non-elected public roles appointed by elected officials**: all non-elected roles would be appointed at the discretion of an elected role - which elected officials would oversee which appointments would need to be established.

> _Goal_: preventing non-elected roles becoming permanently held.

3. **Non-salaried elected office**: elected individuals would finance their offices via a) self-funding through personal savings b) political campaign donations.

> _Goal_: foster non-political experience and smaller staffs.

4. **Remove non-personal political donations**: all donations would be made by individuals and all political expenditures would be directly made by the candidate's campaign. PACs and similar operations would not be available.

> _Goal_: close loopholes and reduce financial influence.

5. **Increase individual donation limit**: raise the cap [[1](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/)] on what voters may put towards individual candidate campaigns. Possibly balance this with placing limits on the number of campaigns that could be donated to. Identifying a non-arbitrary rule would be a central focus.

> _Goal_: leveling financial dispartiy influence on elections.

6. **Remove Presidential executive orders**: or significantly reduce the ability to immediately execute orders or decrease their functional scope. Finding a non-arbitrary constraint would be ideal.

> _Goal_: reducing focus on and importance of executive office.
