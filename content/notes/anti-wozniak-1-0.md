Rapid development iteration following patterns like Agile [[1](http://www.agilenutshell.com/)] generates immediate product feedback which may be an antidote against not posessing raw talent displayed by people like Steve Wozniak [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak)].

Avoiding "representing yourself" [[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJif4i9NRdI)] in the product removes the need to build perfection on the first deployment and will still eventually lead to a fully realized end result.
